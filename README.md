# Leaflet-Challenge

For this project, I pulled live earthquake data from the USGS website using a JSON feed. I focused on all earthquakes with a magnitude of 1.0 or higher from the past month. I then built a map that visualizes each quake based on two key factors: magnitude and depth. The stronger the earthquake, the bigger the circle on the map. The deeper it hit, the darker the color. Itâ€™s a quick way to see not just where quakes are happening, but how powerful and deep they are at a glance.
